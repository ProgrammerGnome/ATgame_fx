# ATgame_fx

##  A Theory of Computation mini project in progress using Java and JavaFX GUI. 

### This mini project is still in a non-finished state: it is based on the topics of FSMs (Finite State Machines) and regular expressions.
#### The user can graphically edit an FSM (NFA or DFA) for a given regex pattern, and then verify its correctness. But the program can generate regex pattern with sample strings.

### The program is not ready for use yet!
